## Blue Pirate
The Blue Pirate is a golfing competition run between friends a couple of times a year. We needed a way to keep track of the scores across different handicaps and tee-times. Enter this project!

This project is scaffolded with Padrino and uses Backbone as the framework for the front end.

There's still a number of things to be implemented and some things that were poorly written as deadlines neared.. Maybe I'll come back to them in the future..
